    <p>Hello and welcome to the humble SwiftySites Blog. As a first post I thought it would be nice to share some of my motivation for building this library.</p>
<p>Nowadays it's pretty common for a programmer to want to show their work and process to the world. It's also common for us to write our own tools.</p>
<p>In the past I had used everything from traditional content management systems to popular <a href="https://medium.com/swift-you-and-i">publishing platforms</a>. For the past few years I settled for the awesome <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> static site generator which I used to build the original <a href="https://swiftui.diegolavalle.com">Swift You and I</a> publication.</p>
<p>Hugo has a lot of amazing features which I love but it dows require some knowledge of the Go Language for writing the more advanced <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/text/template">templates</a>. For a long time I tried my best to learn but never felt as at home as I do when I write Swift.</p>
<p>Looking for options I quiclky landed in John Sundell's tool <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>. To be perfectly honest this would have been the tool to choose from the beginnig – had it existed a couple of years back.</p>
<p>At this point I had gotten accustomed to many of the niceties of Hugo and wanted to keep some of them around. John's <a href="https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/building-dsls-in-swift/">DSL approach</a> showed me that the Swift compiler can really be helpful when defining a website's structure so I came up with a hybrid concept.</p>
<p>Instead of declaring everything straight in Swift I decided to split the problem in two. For the content's metadata – which Hugo implements with <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">Front Matter</a> – I would leverage the full power of Swift's type system. For the templates I thought of something else…</p>
<p>Swift already has a great templating solution called <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/0/5/string-interpolation">string interpolation</a>. This was the last piece of the puzzle. From the first proof of concept I noticed how nicely the structured metadata merged with the more free string composition.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks I will use this very site to test the concept and document the process of building a framework that hopefully other people find useful.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
